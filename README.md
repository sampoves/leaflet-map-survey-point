# leaflet-map-survey-point
This is a Leaflet powered map survey for gathering data with a spatial dimension. User inserts points and answers to questions regarding the marked location. This map survey was created for my master's thesis, but I ended up using a different approach, switching from point based response to an area (polygon) based. As a result, this map survey version is severely unfinished. I may add the functionality of the area map survey to this version later.
